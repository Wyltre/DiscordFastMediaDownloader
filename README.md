## Features

- 🚀 Lightweight and fast
- 🖼️ Supports both images and videos

- 📱 Responsive design
- ⚡ No external dependencies

## Installation

1. Download the `FastMediaDownloader.plugin.js` file
2. Discord > Settings > Plugins Open the plugin file and drop the file you downloaded

## How it works

The plugin automatically detects media elements (images and videos) on your page and adds a download button when you hover over them. The button appears in the top-left corner with a smooth animation and allows users to download the media file directly.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the download button by modifying the CSS in the `media-downloader-style` block:

```css
.download-button {
    background-color: #5865F2; /* Change button color */
    color: white; /* Change text color */
    padding: 5px 10px; /* Adjust padding */
    /* Add more custom styles */
}
```
